# expect - programmed dialogue with interactive programs

Expect is a tool for automation of text/terminal based applications. In simple terms it listens for output and if the 'expected' output comes the predefined action is executed.

**Description (excerpt from `man` page): **

> Expect is a program that "talks" to other interactive programs according  to  a script.  Following the script, Expect knows what can be expected from a program and what the correct response should be.
> 
>  An interpreted language provides branching and  high‚Äêlevel  control  structures  to direct the dialogue.  In addition, the user can take control and interact directly when desired, afterward returning control to the script.
