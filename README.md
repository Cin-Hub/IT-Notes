# IT-Notes

You are very welcome to use my notes and to participate. But remember, they are neither complete nor generally valid.

The structure of my notes changed over time, here are my current standards.

## Filenames

I try to name my files in this format: `file_name.cin.extension` or `file_name.extension.cin`

Example: `script.cin.sh` or `script.sh.cin`

## Copy & Paste

I often use variables in my notes, when a few steps need to be done. This way I need to type less and use copy & paste more efficient.

Example:

```shell
MAIN_PATH=
```
```shell
mkdir -p $MAIN_PATH
```
```shell
cd $MAIN_PATH
```
